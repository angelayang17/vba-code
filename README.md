# vba-code : a repository for some of my Excel VBA code.

## Module 1
"Module1" features VBA code that I wrote for a school project. The aim was to assign a total of 500 students to seven different Halls (on-campus residences), keeping to their ranked preferences wherever possible and subject to limited vacancies in each hall. If students were unable to be successfully assigned to a hall, we had to place them on a ranked waitlist. We were also tasked to ensure that our code minimizes bias, for instance by accidentally giving priority based on an alphabetical order of names. Ultimately, I ordered the students using a randomized sorter function, and wrote the VBA code using the help of macros along the way. Here is an example of a portion of the database, with each student's matriculation number and number of Hall preferences:

## Maze
"Maze" features VBA code that was also written for a school assignment, and the aim was to solve a maze (see images attached for examples). The end goal was for the red square to reach the yellow square.
